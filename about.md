# 🌴 Hey there, I'm Kiran 🤝

I'm a CS student 👨‍💻 who loves to explore anything that interests me. I love to know why and how things work under the hood, this encourages and excites me to dig deep into certain topics. Learning something new gives me a thrill and this has always been my driving force.

### What can I do ❓

- I can code Java, C, Python, Javascript, Django, Julia.
- I'm more of a developer kind and ofcourse loves algorithmic problems but not competitive.
- I'm an ML guy. I don't just want to code off a snippet, I want to know what's the crux of those lines of code. This made me learn a bit of maths (Which I sadly neglected during my first year :man_facepalming:)
- Now, I'm into Deep Learning and looking forward to strengthen my base in this area.
- I'm also an open source contributor. I believe open source is something we should be thankful where people work day and night without expecting profit. I'd love to be a part of this system and do my best to help my favourite projects.
