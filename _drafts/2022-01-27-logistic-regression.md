### What is classification? 

If you've gone through [my previous post about linear regression](https://chandrakiran.tech/2021/12/07/linear-regression.html), then there is high chance that you know what regression is. Regression is generally refers to mapping the input data to a continuous target variable i.e $$y \in R$$. In classification, the target variable is a discrete set of values i.e $$y$$ is countable. Classification is more extensively used in real world applications than compared to regression. Some application of classification are:

* Credit card fraud detection.
* Face recognition.
* Sentiment analysis.
* Speech recognition.
* Email spam detection.

Looking at the above applications will tell you how useful and important classification is! Let's start learning it.
