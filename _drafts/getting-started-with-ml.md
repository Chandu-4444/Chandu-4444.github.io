### So, you're interested in learning ML?
> "A good start is half the work"

Yeah, I'm glad that you took a step to make a better version of yourself in ML. In this short article, I'll help you in _getting started with ML_. Me being a learner, and am still learning will try my best to point out resources, tips and few practices that I followed during my early stages of learning.

>"Getting started is always the hardest step"

That says it all! And trust me, this is true. But it's worth it and will truely boost your confidence. So let's get started!

### Mathematics
This is almost the first question that you've probably search for. I'm not going to tell you mathematics isn't important nor I'll tell you it's everything. You can build a great recommender system like Netflix did, or create that addictive algorithm like TikTok without any knowledge of mathematics. But the problem comes when you can't understand why they're so beautiful, why excatly they're so popular. This all questions leads to the mathematics behind them. You'll probably never appreciate any ML algorithm until you get a grasp of mathematics behind them. 

I remember a saying **"Machine Learning is for mathematicians who can program"**. This almost true to believe, only is it was the other way around **"Machine Learning is for programmers who knew mathematics"**. Yeah, that's prefect.

_Statistics and Probability_, _Calculus_, _Linear  Algebra_

These three were the pillars behind any machine learning algorithm. So if you want to get the essence of an algorithm in ML you should be comfortable with the above three, not equally ofcourse.

Yes, to my experience you have to be **60%** familiar with P&S, **20%** familiar with Linear Algebra, **20%** familiar with Calculus (A rough estimation). By familiarity I mean here that if you know 6 chapters in P&S, you have to study 2 chapters in each Linear Algebra and Calculus. 

Now comes the resources part. Hmm let me tell you that I didn't bother much about mathematics during my early stages. But I definitely felt a gap. Unfortunately I didn't study mathematics seriously during my freshmen and sophomore year (I regret this even now). Luckily, the development comes when we realize our mistakes. I realized and started learning those mathematical concepts. I'll now list those:

- [Essential Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLy_2iUCG87D1CXFxE-SxCFZUiJzQ3IvE){:target="_blank"}

  - This is the first mathematics based _playlist_ I've watched. Let me be honest with you, I never completed this in one go. But I used it as a reference whenever I need help with mathematics. Few videos in this playlist takes sometime to make you feel comfortable (Ofcourse it depends).
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)
  - This _book_ is a good one (if you know what to read). Yes! It is not necessary to read whole book, the first part is enough. Each chapter (in the first part) introduces you different mathematical concepts. Read every chapter until you feel comfortable. Keep in mind that few concepts need additional resources to understand (But if you feel it's way to deep, feel free to skip those concepts as I did :) ). 
  
This is a personal recommendation and I'm happy to address few more resources if needed in the comments.
